# Construction of a Dataset for Automatic Prescription Recommendation

## Project Overview
This project is part of the "Projects" course (2nd semester, 1st year of the MSc in Bioinformatics – Universidade do Minho) and focuses on constructing a comprehensive dataset and implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to support automated prescription recommendations, with a specific focus on antibiotic drug interactions (ADIs).

Antibiotic interactions are a major concern in clinical settings due to their potential to reduce drug efficacy, increase toxicity, or even cause fatal outcomes. By leveraging AI and curated data sources, this project supports safer, more informed, and context-aware prescription decisions.
